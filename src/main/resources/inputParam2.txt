A computer programmer, sometimes called a software developer,
 a programmer or more recently a coder (especially in more informal
 contexts), is a person who creates computer software. The term computer
 programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers, or to a
 generalist who writes code for many kinds of software.

A programmer's most often-used computer language (e.g., Assembly,
 COBOL, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lisp, Python, Java) may be prefixed
 to the term programmer. Some who work with web programming languages
 also prefix their titles with web.
